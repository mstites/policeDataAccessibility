      <h1>Data Advocacy & Abolition (?)</h1>
      <p>There is relevancy in respect to data advocacy and abolition. Quantitative data is valued highly in our society, and using data advocacy to illustrate harms perpetuated by prisons, jails, police, and related entities could assist abolitionist movements in efforts to push for policy changes or to attract people to movements. </p>
      <p>However, as discussed on the <a href="dataProjects.html">Data Spotlight page</a>, there is also potential harm that can come from data advocacy efforts. It is important that before any data advocacy effort is taken, that the potential impacts, particularly harms, are heavily considered. Below, I list a number of external resources which provide important context on this topic. The resources include information such as considerations before doing data work, right to refuse, and the historical context of carceral data violence.</p>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/refusal-a-beginning-that-starts-with-an-end-2b055bfc14be">To Build a Better Future, Designers Need to Start Saying ‘No’</a>
      <p>Article which discusses the concept of design refusal and its potential for good (<a href="sources.html#2">Barabas</a>). The concept of design refusal is underused and under-discussed, but is an important one when the potential for misuse or misapplication of data is high.</p>
      <a href="https://www.manifestno.com/">Manifest-no</a>
      <p>A list of declarations of “refusal and commitment” for feminist data advocacy practices to refuse harmful data practices (<a href="sources.html#10">Cifor et al.</a>). A useful list of things to consider before starting this type of work. Overall, it calls for data projects to form direct relationships with the groups that are being researched, as well as being intentional and proactive of potential impacts.</p> <a href="https://www.carceral.tech/why">Why - Carceral Tech Resistance Network</a>
      <p>Carceral Tech Resistance Network builds archives and databases to “catalog the history, emergence, and dispersion of carceral tech” ("<a href="sources.html#41">What</a>"). They also host training for community organizers to “incorporate tech-facing tactics” into their abolition work ("<a href="sources.html#41">What</a>"). The linked page is about why they do this work against carceral systems ("<a href="sources.html#42">Why</a>"). I recommend this as an example of why and how data advocacy can be important to anti-carceral activist efforts.</p>
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01972243.2021.1920081">Numbers will not save us: Agnostic data practices</a>
      <p>Academic paper which provides criticisms of contemporary data activism for the ways it can damage or place responsibility on the communities it was designed to help (<a href="sources.html#14">Crooks and Currie</a>). It discusses the concept of “agonistic data practices”, which are “tactics which draw on affective and narrative potentialities of data to dispute the terms by which majoritarian political agents rationalize their actions and direct policy” (<a href="sources.html#14">Crooks and Currie</a>). This paper provides important criticism and context for the harms that data advocacy can do if data becomes disconnected from people and stories.</p>
      <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211028252">Against carceral data collection in response to anti-Asian violences</a>
      <p>Academic paper providing criticism on the creation of “data infrastructures by-and for-law enforcement through hate crimes legislation” in response to anti-Asian violences (<a href="sources.html#19">Kuo and Bui</a>). This paper is good context on how carceral data systems can be dangerous, and why any data work needs to consider if it may serve to increase carceral data regimes.</p>
      <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_REV2020.pdf">Reformist reforms vs. abolitionist steps in policing</a>
      <p>A visual guide for evaluating “reformist reforms which continue or expand the reach of policing”, and abolitionist steps that reduce its overall impact ("<a href="sources.html#29">Reformist Reforms</a>"). The same sorts of questions and methods displayed on this document can also be applied when assessing potential data and data adjacent projects (such as pushes for open data) to understand if their impact would fit in with abolitionist movements. Being especially diligent and self-assessing before acting is important, as data projects have a potential to increase carceral data collection depending on how the work is done. For example, data projects that are done in conjunction with police or state agencies could lead to more justification for more police funding. It is important to make sure that any data work is truly serving to reduce police power and benefits the communities most impacted by carceral violence.</p>
