      <h1>Data Advocacy & Abolition (?)</h1>
      <p>There is relevancy in respect to data advocacy and abolition. Quantitative data is valued highly in our
        society, and using data advocacy to illustrate harms perpetuated by prisons, jails, police, and related entities
        could assist abolitionist movements in efforts to push for policy changes or to attract people to movements.
      </p>
      <p>However, as seen on the Data Spotlight page, there is also potential harm that can come from data advocacy
        efforts if they do use framing that contextualizes the extent of the harm of carceral systems. It is important
        that before any data advocacy effort is taken, that the potential impacts, particularly harms, are heavily
        considered. Below, I list a number of external resources which provide important context on this topic. The
        resources include information such as important considerations before doing data work, right to refuse, and the
        historical context of carceral data harms.</p>

        Future, Designers Need to Start Saying ‘No’ (Chelsea Barbas)</a>
      <p>Article which discusses the potential and concept of design refusal. The concept of design refusal is underused
        and underdiscussed, but is an important one when the potential for misuse or misapplication of data is high.</p>
      <a href="https://www.manifestno.com/">Manifest-no</a>
      <p>A list of declarations of “refusal and commitment” for feminist data advocacy practices to refuse harmful
        data practices. A useful list of things to consider/follow before starting this type of work. Overall, it
        calls for data projects to form direct relationships with the groups that are being researched, as well as
        intentionality and being proactive about potential impacts.</p>
      <a href="https://www.carceral.tech/why">Why - Carceral Tech Resistance Network</a>
      <p>Carceral Tech Resistence Network builds archives and databases to “catalog the the history, emergence, and
        dispersion of
        carceral tech”. They also host training for community organizers to “incorporate tech-facing tactics” into
        their abolition work. The linked page is about why they do this work against carceral systems. I recommend
        this as an example of why and how data advocacy can be important to anti-carceral activist efforts.</p>
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01972243.2021.1920081">Numbers will not save us: Agnostic
        data practices (Roderic Crooks)</a>
      <p>Academic paper which provides criticisms of contemporary data
        activism for the ways it can damage or place responsibility on the communities it was designed to help. It
        discusses the concept of “agonistic data practices”, which are “tactics which draw on affective and narrative
        potentialities of data to dispute the terms by which majoritarian political agents rationalize their actions
        and direct policy”. This paper provides important cricisim and context for the harms that data advocacy can do
        if data becomes disconnected from people and stories.</p>
      <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211028252">Against carceral data collection
        in response to anti-Asian violences (Rachel Kuo, Matthew Bui)</a>
      <p>Academic paper providing criticism on
        the creation of “data infrastructures by-and for-law enforcement through hate crimes legislation” in response
        to anti-Asian violences. This paper is good context on how carceral data systems can be dangerous, and why any
        data work needs to consider if it may serve to increase carceral data regimes.</p>
      <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_REV2020.pdf">Reformist
        reforms vs. abolitionist steps in policing (Critical Resistance)</a>
      <p>A visual guide for evaluating “reformist reforms which continue or expand the reach of policing”, and
        abolitionist steps that reduce its overall impact. The same sorts of questions and methods displayed on this
        document can also be applied when assessing potential data and data adjacent (such as pushes for open data)
        projects to understand if their impact would fit in with abolitionist movements. Being especially diligent and
        self-assessing before acting is important, as data projects have a potential to increase carceral data
        collection depending on how the work is done. For example, data projects that are done in conjunction with
        police or state agencies could lead to more justification forpolice funding. It is important to make sure that
        any data work is truly serving to reduce police power and benefits the communities most impacted by carceral
        violence.</p>
