      <h1>Data Project Spotlight</h1>
      <p>To give context to the <a href=policeData.html>exploration of police data accessibility</a>, I curated a list of data projects to give some context into the work that is being done with policing data. My hope is that this resource can spark curiosity about the potential of policing data based data work to support abolitionist movements. I selected projects to characterize my search experience, with examples selected to represent the different categories of projects I came across (such as projects working more directly with policing organizations in pursuit of an "accountability" approach versus others that were more aligned with abolitionist values).</p>
      <p>In addition to policing data projects, I included links to other works; namely projects analyzing COVID-19 in prison and jail systems. I share these projects to give a wider view of how data advocacy could be applicable for calling attention to carceral harms.</p>
      <h2>Framing Problems & Reformist Approaches</h2>
      <p>Many of the projects that I encountered in my search were framed as "police accountability" initiatives in some form. Some projects were very direct about this, such as the <a href="https://www.policedatainitiative.org/">Police Data Initiative</a> which "promotes the use of open data to encourage joint problem solving" and is funded directly by policing organizations with the goal to "co-produce public safety" ("<a href="sources.html#27">Police Data Initiative</a>"). Others were less direct, such as the <a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity</a>, which works directly with police to obtain data but does not receive police funding (<a href="sources.html#3">Barlow et al., "Center for Policing Equity"</a>). They have values and recommendations which would generally reduce police funding and scale, such as the value for the creation of public safety other than policing (<a href="sources.html#3">Barlow et al., "Our Principles"</a>). These suggestions are inline with abolitionist reforms ("<a href="sources.html#30">Reformist Reforms</a>"). However, more widely, their project includes documents and policy recommendations suggesting that just policing is possible through reforms and police-community collaboration (<a href="sources.html#4">Barlow et al., "Policy Plan"</a>).</p>
      <h3>Problem of Reformist Framings</h3>
      <p>Reformist framings in data projects have the potential to create problematic assumptions in analysis. For instance, in one of the Police Equity Center reports they use neighborhood crime rate data as a component of their police racial bias analysis, using crime rates as a potential for why police may have arrested more people in a neighborhood (<a href="sources.html#4">Barlow et al., “San Diego"</a>). This is a problematic assumption, as police organizations track and report these crime rate statistics (<a href="sources.html#4">Barlow et al., “San Diego"</a>). This gives police direct control over crime rates. Additionally, by policing communities more than others, report and arrest rates will inevitably go up, turning that area into a "high crime" area simply by patrolling it more.</p>
      <p>For testing bias of an organization, this data project used comparison data that can be controlled and manipulated by the same organization they are testing. This creates a potential to underestimate police racial bias. The Center for Policing Equity even acknowledges this concern in their methodology, but by using the assumption of the validity of crime rate statistics, they give legitimacy to crime rate statistics and justification to the over policing of Black neighborhoods (<a href="sources.html#4">Barlow et al., “San Diego"</a>).</p>
      <p>Framing projects in the pursuit of "police accountability" suggests that police can be reformed to not perpetuate these harms on their communities. This framing is problematic, and does not acknowledge the systemic injustices that have occurred and continue to occur. Even the results of the police "accountability" provide evidence of systemic racial profiling and racial disparities in use of force (<a href="sources.html#7">Barlow et al., “National Justice Database Study"</a>). But despite these results, these reformist projects fail to fully acknowledge police harms and center the communities impacted.</p>
      <h3>Potential Value of more Reformist Projects</h3>
      <p>All this said, these "accountability" framed projects can still have some value. The statistical results they generate still provide evidence for the systemic patterns of harms that disproportionately impact low-income communities of color. There is potential for re-using the statistical results from these projects through abolitionist framings and initiatives. Additionally, the raw data that is gathered for these projects can be used for data work that is more inline with abolitionist values.</p>
      <p>As someone who has worked on a data advocacy project using policing data, I wonder if the framing of "accountability" and reformist framings makes the acquisition of data and funding more attainable. Projects like the earlier mentioned Policing Equity project, despite not being police funded, have received data directly from volunteering police departments. This data would have been very difficult, if not impossible, for a publicly framed abolitionist project to acquire.</p>
      <p>Thus, these projects can teach an important lesson about the importance of framing in data projects. It is important to consider if the framing of a project will create more harm than good; such as by interpreting results in a way that disregards the systemic patterns that have occurred, and continue to occur, in an effort to present a hopeful future for policing.</p>
      <p>But also, it may be worth considering if stepping back from a direct abolitionist framing could be a useful strategy to attain policing data, especially with the rise in power of police unions which could create dangerous backlash if abolition driven data advocacy efforts start to gain traction (<a href="sources.html#35">Scheiber et al.</a>). I believe there is value in an abolitionist framing for data projects, but there is also potential for data work that takes a behind the scenes approach by not labeling itself publicly as abolitionist to ease the data acquisition process. Once acquired, this data could be used more widely and publicly in pursuit of abolitionist efforts.</p>

      <h2>Policing Data Projects</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3 id="mapping-police-violence"><a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">Mapping Police Violence</a></h3> <img class="project" src="assets/img/spotlight/mappingPoliceViolence-map.jpg">
        <p class="fig-cap">Screenshot of the interactive map illustrating every police killing in 2021 from the Mapping Police Violence project</p>
        <p>Project Description: Collection of interactive tools, maps, and figures that illustrate police violence in the United States (<a href="sources.html#36">Sinyangwe, "Mapping Police"</a>). Includes an interactive map of the US, showing people killed by police for each day in 2021. Also includes information on police killings per state through several demographics such as race, gender, reported armed status, cause of death, and year.</p>
        <p>This project illustrates the visual narrative power potential of data projects. I have seen police killing statistics numerous times; however, the implementation into interactive visualizations creates a strong storytelling approach and connected with me at a very personal level. The project also maintains a level of humanity in data, by connecting names to the deaths on its interactive map. This aligns with interventions and suggestions from more abolitionist data advocacy perspectives, more on the <a href="data&abolotion.html">Data and Abolition page</a> (<a href="sources.html#17">Crooks and Currie</a>; <a href="sources.html#12">Cifor et al.</a>)</p>

        <h3><a href=https://policescorecard.org/findings>Police Scorecard</a></h3> <img class="project" src="assets/img/spotlight/policeScorecard-interact.jpg">
        <p class="fig-cap">Screenshot of the Police Scorecard's interactive data visualization tool which shows racial discrimination for each department in the dataset based on user selectable metrics (e.g. Drug Arrest Rates, Deadly Force)</p>
        <p>Project Description: The Police Scorecard is touted as the first nationwide public evaluation in the United States (<a href="sources.html#28">Monck et al., "Project Methodology"</a>). It's goal is to provide insight to the many issues in policing to "help communities, researchers, police leaders and policy-makers take data-informed action to reduce police use of force, increase accountability and reimagine public safety in their jurisdictions" (<a href="sources.html#28">Monck et al., "Project Methodology"</a>).</p>
        <p>While this project takes a more reformist approach, it still has value due to its sheer scale. It was, by far, the largest and comprehensive project of its type I came across and the results still tell important stories. One critique of the project in regard to its reformist approach is that in many of its interpretations, it focuses on calling out the "worst offenders" to call for "urgent investigations and interventions prioritizing the lowest-performing departments" (<a href="sources.html#27">Monck et al., "Key Findings"; Monck et al., "Police Scorecard"</a>). While there is certainly value in focusing activism efforts on the agencies that are creating the most harm in their communities, emphasizing the harms of individual agencies over others takes away from the important message that policing has systematic flaws, separate from individual departments or officers. This project once again shows the importance of framing, and if data advocacy efforts are used to focus activism efforts on individual agencies, it is vital to not underscore the systematic harm by positioning some police agencies as partly "good".</p>
        <p>Despite this partly reformist approach, many of their suggestions in their report suggest activism which would reduce police scale: alternatives to police for responding to emergencies, banning certain police use of force actions, weakening police unions, and banning discretionary searches (<a href="sources.html#26">Monck et al., "Evaluating Policing"</a>).</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3><a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity & Associated Projects</a></h3>
        <p>Project Description: The <a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity</a> is a research center based at Yale University (<a href="sources.html#5">Barlow et al., "Center"</a>). They work directly with police to acquire data to create impact statistics and policy suggestions (<a href="sources.html#5">Barlow et al., "Center"</a>). They have also launched a corrarily project, the <a href=https://justicenavigator.org/#home-assessments>Justice Navigator</a>, a tool specifically aimed at helping police departments and communities make changes backed by data to reduce racial disparities in policing (<a href="sources.html#6">Barlow et al., "Justice Navigator"</a>).</p>
        <p>I chose to feature this project as an example of an academia backed, well funded data project doing work with policing data. The project proclaims a number of assumptions about policing, notably centering the reduction of racial bias through working directly with police as a solution to policing issues. There is value in some of its results, as it has been able to get unique data through its partnerships with police and many of its results help to reveal policing racial bias. However, it makes a number of dangerous assumptions that incorrectly paint carceral harms. The project illustrates potential shortfalls of data projects that are based in academia (i.e. the work is done by people who are relatively privileged and removed from the impacts of policing), as well as problems of working with organizations with conflicting values (i.e. working with police to call out their harm, but police have incentive to hide harms to protect their organization and their funding, which is directly counter to the purpose of the data project). One dangerous assumption they made was the validity of crime rate statistics (<a href="sources.html#5">Barlow et al., "Norman City"; <a href="sources.html#3">Barlow et al.,"Assessments"</a>). They used FBI crime rate statistics to adjust for use of force statistics in racial bias (<a href="sources.html#5">Barlow et al., "Norman City"</a>). While they acknowledge that systemic factors can cause over policing of Black neighborhoods, this assumption still has high potential to under-estimate racial targeting by police officers (<a href="sources.html#5">Barlow et al., "Norman City"</a>).</p>
        <p>Being able to pick apart data analysis processes requires technical background. It would be easy to take the Center for Policing Equity's results at face value without being able to dig deeper; most people do not have much experience with data science nor statistics. There is certainly a high potential for danger and misuse when working with policing data, especially when methodology is obscured from the results.</p>

      <h2>Other Data Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are some non-policing data centered projects that I found during my search. I believe these are important contexts when considering the wider potential applications of data advocacy and activist movements, as non-policing data can be easier to acquire in many cases and has potential to be more reliable, as it may not be controlled by carceral entities.</p> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2782809">Association Between Prison Crowding and COVID-19 Incidence Rates in MA Prisons</a>
      <p>A study which used statistical analysis to prove that prison crowding led to higher cases of COVID-19 using data acquired from an <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/cases/committee-public-counsel-services-v-chief-justice-trial-court-and-committee-public-counsel">ACLU lawsuit</a> (<a href="sources.html#23">Leibowitz et al.; <a href="sources.html#15">"Committee for Public"</a>). The tracking website for the data acquired from this lawsuit, in conjunction with other then publicly available data, can be seen <a href="https://data.aclum.org/sjc-12926-tracker/">here</a> ("<a href="sources.html#44">Tracking COVID-19</a>").</p> <a href="https://livesontheline.org/report/">Lives on the Line: Women with Incarcerated Loved Ones and the Impact of COVID-19 Behind Bars</a>
      <p>Data project by the Essie Justice Group, a nonprofit organization of women with incarcerated loved ones "taking on the rampant injustices caused by mass incarceration" (<a href="sources.html#14">Clayton-Johnson et al.</a>). This report was created in response to COVID-19 conditions in jails and prisons and created a survey to send out to incarcerated peoples loved ones to get concrete data that can "illustrate what was happening behind bars and buoy the efforts of advocates across the country fighting to free incarcerated people amidst the COVID-19 pandemic" (<a href="sources.html#14">Clayton-Johnson et al.</a>).</p>
      <p>I chose to link this project, as it is an example of an abolitionist framed data project, and an example of a project which quantifies harms of the carceral state without relying on carceral data (i.e. data collected directly by police or prisons, with the potential for intentional manipulation or other data quality issues). </p> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352850/">Abortion Access for Incarcerated People: Incidence of Abortion and Policies at U.S. Prisons and Jails (<a href="sources.html#43">Sufrin</a>)</a>
