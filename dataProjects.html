      <h1>Data Project Spotlight</h1>
      <p>Examples of a few different data projects. Selected some different types to share to try to reflect my general
        findings in my search.</p>
      <p>Many of these projects were framed as "police accountability" in some way shape or form. Some very directly.
        At first, I was very thrown off by this, it seems very reformist. But for some of the projects, it does seem
        like
        it could be a method of getting the data, as they brand themselves in a way to say "hey police departments work
        with me". But at the end of the day, when you look at the reports from these data projects, they at least
        provide
        some quantification of the racism and violence that police departments are doing in their communities. They
        still
        tell a story, and that can have value. However, there certainly is also a sort of gaslightly (irony?) approach
        of
        pretending that there is an accountability possibility while also reporting that police are racial profiling at
        extreme levels and reporting high incidents of violence over sometimes long periods of time - this section
        would need to be re-written </p>

      <h2>Other Data Projects</h2>
      <p>While the focus of my project is on policing data, I found some other data projects in my search that I
        wanted to share. I believe these are important context, as non-policing data can be in many cases easier
        to
        acquire (can remove likely, as I don't think I will have source for this - though for COVID I may).</p>
      <p>It is important context because: I wanted to give some non-policing examples so you may have broader
        ideas
        of
        potential for data advocacy, particularly when discussing critiques (on other page); there is potential
        for
        less risk and thus potentially more possibilites when working on other forms of data projects, as it can
        be
        data less directly controlled by policing agencies (as policing data is recorded police themselves);
