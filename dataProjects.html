      <h1>Data Project Spotlight</h1>
      <p>To give context to my exploration of police data accessibility, I have created a list of a select number of
        data projects to give some context to the data advocacy work that is being done with policing data. My hope is
        that this can serve to provide some some insight into the potentials of using policing data for data advocacy
        efforts to support abolitionist efforts. I selected projects that I believed characterized the experience of my
        search (i.e. selecting different examples to represent the different categories of projects I came across, such
        as projects working more directly with policing organizations in pursuit of an "accountability" approach versus
        others that seemed more directly aligned with abolitionist values).</p>
      <p>In addition to policing data projects, I also included a few links to data projects around COVID-19 and the
        prision industrial complex, as this is a very prevalent issue and gives a wider view of how data advocacy could
        be useful for shedding light on carceral harms using quantitative approaches.</p>
      <h2>The problem of Framing</h2>
      <p>Many of the projects that I encountered in my search (and listed below) were framed as "police accountability"
        projects in some way shape or form. Some were very direct about this, such as the <a
          href="https://www.policedatainitiative.org/">Police Data Initiative</a> which "promotes the use of open data
        to encourage joint problem solving" and funded directly by policing organizations with the goal to "co-produce
        public safety". Others were less direct, such as the initiatives under the <a
          href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity</a> which work directly with police to obtain
        data, but are not police funded. Many of their suggestions from their reports are changes which would generally
        reduce police funding and scale, and suggest creations of other sources of public safety other than policing.
        However, it is worth noting, that they also have many documents which suggest that successful collaboration
        between police and their communities is possible with just a few changes (<a
          href="https://policingequity.org/images/pdfs-doc/reports/A-Case-Study-in-Hope.pdf">Policing Equity: A Case
          Study in Hope</a>). This framing also had the potential to create problematic assumptions in analysis, For
        example, in <a href="https://justicenavigator.org/report/sandiego-county-ca-2021/ps"></a>one of the policing
        equity analyses</a>, they use crime rates by neighborhood as an indicator for why police may be stopping more
        people there to test for bias. This is a problematic assumption, as police organizations (federal and/or state)
        are the organizations that track crime rates, which is even acknowledge in their methodology. They also have a
        direct control over crime rates, as by policing communities more than others, that area will inevitably become a
        "high crime" area, since that is the area where police are patroling the most and thus will arrest the most
        people. This means that for testing bias, this data project used data that is controlled and has heavy potential
        to be manipulated by police. This creates a dangerous image, and potential to underestimate police racial bias.
      </p>
      <p>When I kept seeing this framing in my search, I was frustrated. Because framing projects in the pursuit of
        "police accountability" suggests that police can be reformed to not perpetuate these harms on their communities.
        This framing is problematic, because policing is fundamentally flawed in the United States and perpetuates harms
        upon the communities they exist in, especially through the over policing of communities of color (Source if
        Time). This can be seen even through the results of these "accountability" projects, which clearly demonstrate
        year upon year of systemic racial profiling, unarguabbly unnecessary use of force, and a lack of ability to
        ensure safety (See: <a
          href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/initiatives/national-justice-database-study.cfm">National
          Justice Database Study: St. Louis</a>). While I appreciate that some of the suggestions for these more
        accountability framed projects still do reduce the scale of policing, they also perpuate harmful narratives by
        giving false takeaways by taking systemic patterns and providing suggestions that propose policing as something
        that can hold hope.</p>
      <p>All this said, I think these projects still have some value. The statistical results they come away with still
        provide backing for the systemic patterns of harms that the communities impacted by know exist. There could be
        potential for using these same results in other, more abolitionist, framings to increase support for movements
        or push for abolitionist reforms. The other potential value is that these projects gather raw data that could be
        used for other, abolitionist driven, data projects. As someone who has worked in this area, I have to wonder if
        by framing a project in an "accountability" light and working with police more directly eases the acquisition of
        data and the ability to get funding. Projects like the earlier mentioned Policing Equity project, despite not
        being police funded, has gotten access to data directly from police depatrments. This likely would have been
        very difficult, if not impossible, for a publicly abolitionist framed project to attain.</p>
      <p>Thus, these projects can still teach an important lesson about the considerations of framing data projects. It
        is important to consider if the framing of a project will create more harm than good; such as by interpreting
        results in a way that diseregards the systemic patterns that have occured, and continue to occur, to present a
        hopeful future for policing. But also, it may be worth considering if stepping back from a directly abolitionist
        framing could be a useful strategy to attain policing data, especially with the <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/police-unions-minneapolis-kroll.html">rise in power of police
          unions</a> which could create dangerous backlash if abolition driven data advocacy efforts start to gain
        traction. I believe there is value in an abolitionist framing for data projects, but also that there could be
        support data work that takes a bit of the behind the scene approach by not labeling itself as such in an effort
        to acquire data that could be used widely in pursuit of abolitionist efforts.</p>

        <p class="fig-cap">Screenshot of the Police Scorecard's interactive data visualization tool which shows racial
          discrimination for each department in the dataset based on user selectable metrics (e.g. Drug Arrest Rates,
          Deadly Force)</p>
        <p>Project Description: The Police Scorecard is claimed as the first nationwide public evaluation in the United
          States. It's goal is to provide insight to the many issues in policing to "help communities, researchers,
          police leaders and policy-makers take data-informed action to reduce police use of force, increase
          accountability and reimagine public safety in their jurisdictions" (<a
            href="https://policescorecard.org/about">Project About Page</a>).</p>
        <p>While this project takes a more reformist approach, it still has value due to its shear scale. It was, by
          far, the largest and comprehensive project of its type I came across and the results still tell important
          stories. One critique of the project in regard to its reformist approach is that in many of its
          interpretations, it focuses on calling out the "worst offenders" to call for "urgent investigations and
          interventions prioritizing the lowest-performing departments" (<a href="https://policescorecard.org/findings">
            Project Key Findings</a>, <a href="https://policescorecard.org/us/police-department">Police Department
            Scoring</a>). While there is certainly value in focusing activism efforts on the agencies that are creating
          the most harm in their communities, emphasizing the harms of individual agencies takes away from the important
          message that policing has systematic flaws, separate from individual departments or officers. This raises
          broader questions about where abolitionist efforts should be focused in regard to making change in local
          communities versus more nationwide efforts. More importantly I believe this once again calls out the
          importance of framing, and if data advocacy efforts are used to focus activism efforts on individual agencies,
          making sure to not underscore the systematic harm by positioning some police agencies as partly "good".</p>
        <p>I do also want to note that despite this, many of their suggestions in their report suggest approaches which
          would reduce police scale such as calls responses to emergencies other than police, banning certain police use
          of force actions, weakening police unions, and banning discretionary searches (<a

        <h3><a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity & Associated Projects</a></h3>
        <p>Project Description: The <a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity</a> is a research
          center based at Yale University. They work
          directly with police to acquire data to create impact statistics and policy suggestions. They have also
          launched a corrarily project, the <a href=https://justicenavigator.org/#home-assessments>Justice Navigator</a>
          which is a tool specifically aimed at helping police departments and communities make changes backed by data
          to reduce racial disparities in policing.</p>
        <p>I chose to feature this project as an example of an academia backed, well funded data project doing work with
          policing data. The project proclaims a number of assumptions about policing, notably centering the reduction
          of racial bias through working directly with police as a solution to policing issues. There is certain value
          in some of its results, as it has been able to get unique data through its partnerships with police and many
          of its results help to reveal policing racial bias. However, overall, I would argue it makes a number of
          dangerous assumptions that incorrectly paint carceral harms and illustrates potential shortfalls of data
          projects that are based in academia (i.e. the work is done by people who are significantly privilileged and
          removed from the impacts of policing) and work with organizations with conflicting values (i.e. working with
          police to call out their harm, but they have incentive to hide harms to protect their organization and their
          funding). One dangerous assumption they made was the validity of crime rate statistics (<a
            href="https://justicenavigator.org/report/norman-city-ok-2021/uof">Norman City Report</a>, <a
            href="https://justicenavigator.org/#home-assessments">See other reports on site</a>). They used FBI crime
          rate statistics to adjust for use of force statistics in racial bias. While they acknowledge that systemic
          factors can cause over policing of Black neighborhoods, this assumption has a high potential for under
          estimating racial targeting by police officers and by doing the analysis this way alone they back up the
          validity of police collected and police controlled crime rate statistics.</p>
        <p>Being able to pick apart data analysis processes requires technical background. It would be easy to take
          their results at face value without being able to dig deeper, especially since most people do not have much
          experience with data science nor statistics. There is certainly a high potential for danger and misuse when
          working with policing data, especially when methodology is hidden from results.</p>

      <h2>Other Data Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are some non-policing data centered projects that I found during my search. I believe these are important
        context when considering the wider potential applications of data advocacy and activist movements, as
        non-policing data can be easier to acquire in many cases and has potential to be more reliable, as it may not be
        controlled by carceral entities.</p>

      <p>I chose to link this project, as it is an example of a abolitionist framed data project, and an example of a
        project which quantifys harms of the carceral state without relying on carceral data (i.e. data collected
        directly by police or prisons, with the potential for intentional manipulation or other data quality issues).
