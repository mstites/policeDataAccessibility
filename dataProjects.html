      <h1>Data Project Spotlight</h1>
      <p>To give context to my exploration of police data accessibility, I curated a list of data projects to give some context into the data advocacy work that is being done with policing data. My hope is that this resource can serve to provide some some insight into the potentials of using policing data for data work in support abolitionist efforts. I selected projects to characterize my search experience, selecting different examples to represent the different categories of projects I came across (such as projects working more directly with policing organizations in pursuit of an "accountability" approach versus others that were more aligned with abolitionist values).</p>
      <p>In addition to policing data projects, I also included a links to data projects about COVID-19 and prision and jail systems. I share these projects to give a wider view of how data advocacy could be more broadly applicable for calling attention to carceral harms.</p>
      <h2>Framing Problems & Reformist Approaches</h2>
      <p>Many of the projects that I encountered in my search (some listed below) were framed as "police accountability" projects in some way shape or form. Some were very direct about this, such as the <a href="https://www.policedatainitiative.org/">Police Data Initiative</a> which "promotes the use of open data to encourage joint problem solving" and funded directly by policing organizations with the goal to "co-produce public safety". Others were less direct, such as the initiatives under the <a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity</a>, which works directly with police to obtain data, but are not police funded. Many of their suggestions from their reports are changes which would generally reduce police funding and scale, and suggests the creation of public safety other than policing. However, it is worth noting, that they also have many documents which suggest that successful collaboration between police and their communities is possible with just a few changes (<a href="https://policingequity.org/images/pdfs-doc/reports/A-Case-Study-in-Hope.pdf">Policing Equity: A Case Study in Hope</a>).</p>
      <p>Reformist framings have the potential to create problematic assumptions in analysis. For instance, in <a href="https://justicenavigator.org/report/sandiego-county-ca-2021/ps"></a>one of the Police Equity Center analyses</a>, they use crime rates by neighborhood as an indicator for why police may be stopping more people when analyzing racial bias. This is a problematic assumption, as police organizations are the organizations that track and report crime rates. This gives police also have a direct control over crime rates. Additionally, by policing communities more than others, report and arrest rates will inevitably go up, turning that area into a "high crime" area simply by patrolling it more.</p>
      <p>For testing bias of an organization, this data project used comparison data that can be controlled and manipulated by the same organization they are testing. This creates a potential to underestimate police racial bias. The Center for Policing Equity even acknowledges this concern in their methodology, but by using this assumption they give legitimiacy to crime rate statistics.</p>
      <p>When I kept seeing "police accountability" framing in my search, I was frustrated. Because framing projects in the pursuit of "police accountability" suggests that police can be reformed to not perpetuate these harms on their communities. This framing is problematic, and does not acknowledge the systemic injustices that have occured and continue to occur. Even these police "accountability" projects still demonstrate year upon year of sytemic racial profiling, unarguabbly unnecessary use of force, and a lack of ability to ensure safety (See: <a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/initiatives/national-justice-database-study.cfm">National Justice Database Study: St. Louis</a>). But despite these clear results, these projects still fail to consistently acknowledge police harms and center the communities impacted.</p>
      <h3>Potential Value of more Reformist Projects</h3>
      <p>All this said, I think these "accountability" framed projects still have some value. The statistical results they generate still provide evidence for the systemic patterns of harms that many in the communities impacted by know exist. There is potential for using these same statistical results in other framings more inline with abolitionist movements and recognition of harms. Additionally, the raw data that is gathered for these projects can also be used for data work that is more inline with abolitionist values.</p>
      <p>As someone who has worked in the field of data advocacy and with policing data, I wonder if by framing a project in an "accountability" light and working with police more directly eases the acquisition of data and funding. Projects like the earlier mentioned Policing Equity project, despite not being police funded, have received data directly from volunteering police depatrments. This data would have been very difficult, if not impossible, for a publicly abolitionist framed project to attain.</p>
      <p>Thus, these projects can still teach an important lesson about the importance of framing in data projects. It is important to consider if the framing of a project will create more harm than good; such as by interpreting results in a way that diseregards the systemic patterns that have occured, and continue to occur, in an effort to present a hopeful future for policing.</p>
      <p>But also, it may be worth considering if stepping back from a directly abolitionist framing could be a useful strategy to attain policing data, especially with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/police-unions-minneapolis-kroll.html">rise in power of police unions</a> which could create dangerous backlash if abolition driven data advocacy efforts start to gain traction. I believe there is value in an abolitionist framing for data projects; but also there is a potential for data work that takes a behind the scene approach, not labeling itself publicly as abolitionist to ease the data acquisition process. Once acquired, this data could be used more widely and publicly in pursuit of abolitionist efforts.</p>

        <p class="fig-cap">Screenshot of the interactive map illustrating every police killing in 2021 from the Mapping Police Violence project</p>
        <p>Project Description: Collection of interactive tools, maps, and figures that illustrate police violence in the United States. Includes an interactive map of the US, showing people killed by police for each day in 2021. Also includes information on police killings per state through severeal demographics such as race, gender, reported armed status, cause of death, and year.</p>
        <p>This project illustrates visual narrative power potential of data projects. I have seen police killing statistics numerous times; however, the implementation into interative visualitiions creates a strong storytelling approach and connected with me at a very personal level.</p>

        <h3><a href=https://policescorecard.org/findings>Police Scorecard</a></h3> <img class="project" src="assets/img/spotlight/policeScorecard-interact.jpg">
        <p class="fig-cap">Screenshot of the Police Scorecard's interactive data visualization tool which shows racial discrimination for each department in the dataset based on user selectable metrics (e.g. Drug Arrest Rates, Deadly Force)</p>
        <p>Project Description: The Police Scorecard is touted as the first nationwide public evaluation in the United States. It's goal is to provide insight to the many issues in policing to "help communities, researchers, police leaders and policy-makers take data-informed action to reduce police use of force, increase accountability and reimagine public safety in their jurisdictions" (<a href="https://policescorecard.org/about">Project About Page</a>).</p>
        <p>While this project takes a more reformist approach, it still has value due to its shear scale. It was, by far, the largest and comprehensive project of its type I came across and the results still tell important stories. One critique of the project in regard to its reformist approach is that in many of its interpretations, it focuses on calling out the "worst offenders" to call for "urgent investigations and interventions prioritizing the lowest-performing departments" (<a href="https://policescorecard.org/findings"> Project Key Findings</a>, <a href="https://policescorecard.org/us/police-department">Police Department Scoring</a>). While there is certainly value in focusing activism efforts on the agencies that are creating the most harm in their communities, emphasizing the harms of individual agencies over others takes away from the important message that policing has systematic flaws, separate from individual departments or officers. This project once again shows the importance of framing, and if data advocacy efforts are used to focus activism efforts on individual agencies, making sure to not underscore the systematic harm by positioning some police agencies as partly "good".</p>
        <p>I do also want to note that despite this partly reformist approach, many of their suggestions in their report suggest activism which would reduce police scale: alternatives to police for responding to emergencies, banning certain police use of force actions, weakening police unions, and banning discretionary searches (<a href="https://policescorecard.org/findings>">Key Findings</a>, <a href="https://policescorecard.org/sandiego">San Diego Report</a>).</p>

        <h3><a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity & Associated Projects</a></h3>
        <p>Project Description: The <a href="https://policingequity.org/">Center for Policing Equity</a> is a research center based at Yale University. They work directly with police to acquire data to create impact statistics and policy suggestions. They have also launched a corrarily project, the <a href=https://justicenavigator.org/#home-assessments>Justice Navigator</a>, a tool specifically aimed at helping police departments and communities make changes backed by data to reduce racial disparities in policing.</p>
        <p>I chose to feature this project as an example of an academia backed, well funded data project doing work with policing data. The project proclaims a number of assumptions about policing, notably centering the reduction of racial bias through working directly with police as a solution to policing issues. There is value in some of its results, as it has been able to get unique data through its partnerships with police and many of its results help to reveal policing racial bias. However, overall, I would argue it makes a number of dangerous assumptions that incorrectly paint carceral harms. The project illustrates potential shortfalls of data projects that are based in academia (i.e. the work is done by people who are relatively privilileged and removed from the impacts of policing), as well as problems of working with organizations with conflicting values (i.e. working with police to call out their harm, but they have incentive to hide harms to protect their organization and their funding). One dangerous assumption they made was the validity of crime rate statistics (<a href="https://justicenavigator.org/report/norman-city-ok-2021/uof">Norman City Report</a>, <a href="https://justicenavigator.org/#home-assessments">See other reports on site</a>). They used FBI crime rate statistics to adjust for use of force statistics in racial bias. While they acknowledge that systemic factors can cause over policing of Black neighborhoods, this assumption still has high potential to under-estimate racial targeting by police officers.</p>
        <p>Being able to pick apart data analysis processes requires technical background. It would be easy to take the Center for Policing Equity's results at face value without being able to dig deeper; most people do not have much experience with data science nor statistics. There is certainly a high potential for danger and misuse when working with policing data, especially when methodology is obscured the from results.</p>

      <h2>Other Data Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are some non-policing data centered projects that I found during my search. I believe these are important context when considering the wider potential applications of data advocacy and activist movements, as non-policing data can be easier to acquire in many cases and has potential to be more reliable, as it may not be controlled by carceral entities.</p> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2782809">Association Between Prision Crowding and COVID-19 Incidence Rates in MA Prisons</a>
      <p>A study which used statistical analysis to prove that prison crowding lead to higher cases of COVID-19 using data from acquired from an <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/cases/committee-public-counsel-services-v-chief-justice-trial-court-and-committee-public-counsel">ACLU lawsuit</a>. The tracking website for the data acquired from this lawsuit, in conjunction with other then publicly available data, can be seen <a href="https://data.aclum.org/sjc-12926-tracker/">here</a>.</p> <a href="https://livesontheline.org/report/">Lives on the Line: Women with Incarcerated Loved Ones and the Impact of COVID-19 Behind Bars</a>
      <p>Data project by the Essie Justice Group, a nonprofit organization of women with incarcerated loved ones "taking on the rampant injustices caused by mass incarceration". This report was created in respones to COVID-19 conditions in jails and prisions and created a survey to send out to incarcerated peoples loved ones to get concrete data that can "illustrate what was happening behind bars and buoy the efforts of advocates across the country fighting to free incarcerated people admist the COVID-19 pandemic".</p>
      <p>I chose to link this project, as it is an example of an abolitionist framed data project, and an example of a project which quantifys harms of the carceral state without relying on carceral data (i.e. data collected directly by police or prisons, with the potential for intentional manipulation or other data quality issues). </p> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352850/">Abortion Access for Incarcerated People: Incidence of Abortion and Policies at U.S. Prisons and Jails</a>
