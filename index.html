            (2 max) in this intro.</li>

      <p>My goal with this website is to provide visitors with
        explain some places where you can get policing data,
      </p>
      <p>I am going to explain some places where you can get policing data based on research I performed using my
        background as a data science person who has prior experience working on a project heavily based around the topic
        of policing data (and going through an active process of trying to get police data).</p>
      <hr>
      <p>INTRO SENTENCE ABOUT MASS INCARCERATION AND HARMS. With this immense amount of carceral violence, - can also
        just skip to below. </p>
      <p>I come from a background heavy in data science. So as I have started learning more about police and prision
        abolition efforts, I have wondered about the potentials for data advocacy as part of these movements. We come
        from a society that values "hard data" and quantifying racial bias in policing or carceral systems has the
        potential to be a persuasive tool for shedding light on systemic racism and the impacts of the prision
        industrial complex (many potentials for data, such as reducing incarceration through evidence in court - though
        this has limiatitions, pushing for abolitionist reforms, growing awareness and participation in abolitionist
        movements).</p>
      <p>The crux of much of data advocacy is in the data sources. It is often difficult, or impossible, to find data
        period. And it is harder still to find data that is of sufficent quality (up to date, not too much missing or
        inaccurate information, enough data points, etc.) to perform the analysis that you actually want to perform. For
        this reason, I wanted to investigate the accessibility and quality of policing data for use in data advocacy
        projects in abolitionist efforts. My goal with this site is to share my learning to hopefully give some
        perspecitive on:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Policies regarding the openness of police data to the public, and what this looks like in practice in terms
          of acquiring data.</li>
        <li>Some of the limitations of using policing data for data advocacy projects, particularly in an abolitionist
          context.</li>
        <li>Examples of data advocacy projects using police data, both abolitionist data projects and also projects that
          are more reformist (or even less so, more info on PAGE).</li>
        <li>Introduction to considerations and dialogue around the positioning of data advocacy in respect to police and
          prision abolition activist movements. What things should we be cautious of when considering data as a
          potential solution?</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Old</h3>
      <p>There are questions to as to how, and if at all, that data advocacy plays a role in abolitionist movements. I
        discuss these in brief on the <a href="data&abolition.html">Data Advocacy & Abolition</a> page. However, to do
        any sort of data advocacy, there needs to be data.

        The crux of data advocacy is within the source data itself. You need data to be able to do analysis on. </p>
      <p>This semester, I got the opportunity to work on a project with the goal of using police citation data to prove,
        with statistical sigificance, racial bias in police traffic stops in the hopes that our findings can be used in
        court to throw out evidence on the basis of racial profiling. Here, our goal is to use data advocacy to prove
        something we already know - that police are racist and that their racist actions lead to the disproportinate
        targetting, gathering of evidence, and incarceration of low-income people of color.</p>
      <p>However, unfortunately through the use of data advocacy, there is the potential to reduce incarceration by
        creating course admissable reports using statistics proving racism </p>
