      <p>I am a student, and this semester I have learned a lot more about anti-police and anti-prison movements. I come
        from a background heavy in data science, and learning more about these movements has made me wonder about the
        potential for data advocacy projects in supporting activist efforts. We come from a society that values “hard
        data” and quantifying racial bias in policing or other carceral systems has the potential to be a persuasive tool
        for shedding light on systemic racism and the harms of the prision industrial complex.</p>
      <p>The crux of much of data advocacy is in the data sources. Without data, there can be no data project. For this
        reason, I wanted to investigate the accessibility of policing data as part of a larger question about the
        application of data advocacy within abolitionist movements. </p>
      <p>I set out to provide both myself, and readers, with answers to three key questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the accessibility of policing data?</li>
        <li>What data advocacy efforts can be done with policing data?</li>
        <li>What are the potential applications, if any, of data advocacy towards police and prison abolition efforts?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To answer these questions, I have created three separate pages as resources:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="policeData.html">Police Data</a> - an outline of key places that police source data can be
          acquired, and provides insights into the accessibility issues of acquiring this data.</li>
        <li><a href="dataProjects.html">Data Project Spotlight</a> - list of a select number of data projects to give
          context on the data advocacy work that is being done with policing data.</li>
        <li><a href="data&abolition.html">Data Advocacy & Abolition</a> - resources for learning more about potential
          pitfalls of data advocacy efforts when used for abolition, as well as best practices for doing data work.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you have general curiosities or questions around abolition, I recommend checking out <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CR_Abolish-Policing-Toolkit_2020.pdf">Critical Resistence's Organizer's Toolkit Document</a>. This resource, intended for use by organizers, includes definitions for key terms and explanations behind abolitionist approaches. I share this resource in particular because it includes a wide breath of abolitionist concepts in one place, using concise but informative descriptions that are intended for people newer to this material.</p>
      <p>For an alternative resource, check out the <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2017/08/prison-abolition-reform-mass-incarceration">What abolitionists Do</a> article by Dan Berger, Mariame Kaba, and David Stein. It is a short read that provides counters to common abolitionist critiques, history and context around abolitionist movements, and brief discussion of future goals of abolition movements.</p>
      <h2>Inspiration & Context from my Own Work</h2>
      <p>Part of the inspiration for this project was the recent community engaged data advocacy work I have done, which has made me think about the wider applications of data advocacy for helping to reduce the impacts of incarceration.</p>
      <p>This semester, I worked on a project with the goal of using police citation data to prove, with statistical sigificance, racial bias in a police officer’s traffic stops. The hope for this effort is that our findings can be used in court to suppress evidence on the basis of racial profiling. Here, our goal is to use data advocacy to prove something that our team and the communities we are working with already know - that police are racist and that their racist actions lead to the disproportinate targetting, gathering of evidence, and incarceration of people of color. However, by giving numerical measures to police racial profiling, there is potential to reduce incarceration by admitting these statistics as evidence in court.</p>
      <p>Working on this project has given me hope that data advocacy can serve a role in reducing the scale of incarceration. But, I must also consider my positionality as someone who is less directly impacted by carceral harms and who works within data science fields as a potential source of bias. I tried to keep this in mind with my work, and also sought out sources critical of data advocacy’s application for activist efforts.</p>
