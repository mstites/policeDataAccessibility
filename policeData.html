      <h1>Police Source Data</h1>
      <p>The basis of any data project relies on access to quality, relevant data. For data projects using policing data to be viable, they need to be able to gain access to this data. On this page, I outline the key places that police source data can be acquired, and use my critical lens as someone with data science and anti-carceral perspectives to provide insights into the accessibility issues of acquiring this data.</p>
      <p>This key goals of this section are to provide:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><b>An understanding of how policing organizations, in many cases, effectively hide or hinder access to data that could be used to quantify the harm they do in their communities.</b> When policing data is hard to access, it prevents data work from analyzing their harms. This serves to obscure their harms, implanting police's place in society.</p>
          <p>While there are other ways to bring to light police harms, I believe data advocacy surrounding the analysis of police racism has the potential to push for meaningful abolitionist reforms and/or to persuade more people to join anti-police, anti-prison movements. I make this claim based on the value that “hard data'' has in society, and there are certainly many people in my own life that have only been able to be moved politically when presented with information in said fashion.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>
            <p>Context and transparency on how data advocacy projects operate in this space, and more room for imagination
          </b> of the potential for data advocacy projects in abolition. For more context on data advocacy projects, refer to the <a href="dataProjects.html">Data Project Spotlight</a> page.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>
            <p>An understanding of where to start looking for police data for purposes of a project or for exploratory purposes.</p>
          </b></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Places to Get Data</h2>
      <p>From my research, I identified three major routes to acquire policing data:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Publicly accessible government data portals (federal, state, and department sites)</li>
        <li>Data advocacy projects that have already collected data</li>
        <li>Public records requests</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Government Data Portals</h3>
      <p>There is some police data already available publicly on government data portals. Examples of these portals include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>
            <p>Federal government portals.
          </b> Police departments are state entities, so most of their data will not be on federal data portals. However, <a href="https://www.data.gov">Data.gov</a>, which primarily hosts federal data, also allows state, local, and tribal governments to publish ("<a href="sources.html#18">How to Get Your Open Data</a>"). Data.gov was created under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ435/PLAW-115publ435.pdf">OPEN Government Data Act</a> and managed by the U.S. General Services ("<a href="sources.html#15">Data.gov</a>"; "<a href="sources.html#28">Public Law 115-435</a>"). The site mostly doesn’t host data directly but serves as a centralized access point for various datasets.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>State, city, or county government data portals.</b> Examples include Boston'’s <a href="https://data.boston.gov/">Analyze Boston open data hub</a> and the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">Chicago Data Portal</a> ("<a href="sources.html#1">Analyze Boston</a>"; "<a href="sources.html#9">Chicago Data</a>"). However, not every state, city, or county will have similar data portals, particularly in respect to policing data. For example, I am working on a team doing work in Brockton, MA. Even though that is also within the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and right next door to Boston, Brockton has no comparable data hub or open data initiative.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>While it is useful that there is already some amount of data publicly available, there can still be problems with these data portals. Datasets may be incomplete or have redacted information that may prevent the dataset from being useful in analysis. For example, a good number of the datasets I checked from the Data.gov searches did not have any race column, which would prevent any sort of racial bias analysis.</p>
      <h3>Other Data Advocacy Projects</h3>
      <p>Data advocacy projects that have performed work on policing data that they obtained through public records requests, or via non-government collection means, often leave a public download to the dataset; such as the Police Scorecard’s <a href="https://policescorecard.org/">source data drive folder link</a> (<a href="sources.html#26">Monck, "Police Scorecard"</a>). This is a useful strategy to allow other data scientists to do other analyses using the same dataset without having the effort and expense of having to obtain data.</p>
      <p>There are also scenarios where a data advocacy effort may be just obtaining the dataset in the support of other data projects and general data accessibility. For example, the <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/">Woke Windows Project</a> provides a variety of data sources containing information about the Boston Police Department (<a href="sources.html#37">Story, "About"</a>). Some of their data is synthesized from publicly available information, which will ease the work of future data scientists as they won't have to repeat this work (<a href="sources.html#37">Story, "About"</a>). The project also includes data that was acquired through public records requests to the City of Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and other entities (<a href="sources.html#36">Story, "Data Exports"</a>)</p>
      <p>Not all data advocacy projects have a download, but many would likely still give over data if requested. Although I cannot speak to all rationales for not including a download, in my own work we have kept datasets and analysis source files private at times for fear that they could be misused or misinterpreted if gotten in the wrong hands (such as police unions). This can be an important ethical question to debate, rather to keep data open or not for fear of misuse. The <a href="https://www.manifestno.com/home">Manifest-no</a>, which is featured on the <a href="data&abolition">Data Advocacy & Abolition page</a>, contains principles which address considerations for data control ethics (<a href="sources.html#10">Cifor, "Manifest-No"</a>).</p>
      <h3>Public Records Request</h3>
      <p>Much of the time, policing data required for an analysis won’t be available publicly. For instance, there is no published comprehensive data on police violence or misconduct (<a href="sources.html#23">Monck, "Key Findings"</a>). This means that to do an analysis on police use of force or misconduct, data would have to be requested through public records requests (<a href="sources.html#24">Monck, "Key Findings"</a>). However, based on both my research and personal experiences, public records requests can be a complicated process that doesn't always get you the information you want.</p>
      <p>Below, I outline a number of barriers and issues when it comes to requesting policing data. This list is based on the synthesis of two major data advocacy projects and written perspectives from Sarah Ryley, an investigative and data journalist for the Boston Globe. The two data advocacy projects I used for this section are the <a href="https://policescorecard.org/">Police Scorecard Project</a> and the <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">Mapping Police Violence Project</a>. More details about these projects can be seen on the <a href="dataProjects.html">data spotlight page</a>.</p>
      <p>Potential issues and barriers when requesting policing data...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><b>Even with data requests, police still continue to hide substantial amounts of data.</b> There are only 12 states where data on police officer’s disciplinary records are open (the data which would be required for an analysis on police violence or misconduct), with 36 states either having restrictions or prohibiting the sharing of these records altogether (<a href="sources.html#21">Lewis, "Police Misconduct a Secret"</a>). And even in states where “this information is supposed to be public record, local police agencies often refuse to comply with public records requests” (<a href="sources.html#23">Monck, "Key Findings"</a>).</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">Mapping Police Violence</a> project, found that "law enforcement agencies across the country" failed to provide them with information about the lives they had taken, even with the reporting mandate from the Death in Custody Reporting Act (<a href="sources.html#33">Sinyangwe, "About the Data"</a>). Despite using crowdsource information to fill in missing information from the public records request data, they were only able to identify 459/1140 (40%) of the officers who had killed people in 2020 (<a href="sources.html#33">Sinyangwe, "2020 Police Violence"</a>; <a href="sources.html#33">Sinyangwe, "About the Data"</a>). This illustrates the data quality issues that can come with public records requests, even if data is acquired. The lack of data quality inhibits data projects from fully analyzing and identifying the scale of the problem and the people involved.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Submitting successful public records requests can depend on having a certain level of technical knowledge which many people will not possess.</b> Sarah Ryley, an investigative and data journalist for the Boston Globe, made a guide with recommendations on <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2020/01/police-data-documentation-public-records-requests/#documentation-links"> how to make a solid public records request</a> (<a href="sources.html#30">Ryley, "What I Learned"</a>). This guide is based on her experience filing dozens of records requests for policing data. While I invite you to read her full article, the key takeaway for this section is that substantial technical and legal know-how is required to navigate public records requests successfully.</p>
          <p>Technical knowledge is required to know how to frame the request: what values to ask for, how to specify details regarding databases and formats to ensure that correct data is acquired, and capability to understand policing database systems to verify that all data is acquired. Legal knowledge is required to navigate common objections that could prevent you from getting data, such as claims that it would be necessary to create a new program to extract data.</p>
          <p>This is also evident when looking through Police Scorecard requests which do a lot of work to address potential roadblocks and ensure that they get the correct data (<a href="sources.html#36">Sinyangwe, "Pinellas County Records"</a>; <a href="sources.html#37">Sinyangwe, "Rapid City Request"</a>). However, even with this know-how and effort, they still had issues getting all the data they needed.</p>
          <p>These knowledge requirements for submitting strong public records requests illustrate a barrier that will stand in the way of many people attaining data. Only very privileged individuals and organizations are likely to possess the technical and legal know-how to best navigate the request systems. Many people who are most impacted by carceral violence, who are disproportionately low-income people of color, will not have access to the education or time to acquire specific legal and technical knowledge required to make strong data requests.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>There can be substantial financial or time barriers to getting data.</b> Public records requests can take a long time, due to delays in responses or high quoted times for claims that it would be necessary to manually redact information file by file (<a href="sources.html#31">Ryley, "What I Learned"</a>; <a href="sources.html#24">Monck, "Key Findings"</a>). Requests can also become insurmountable due to extraordinary high quotas. The Police Scorecard received a $62,173.02 quote from a Sheriff's Office in Florida (<a href="sources.html#24">Monck, "Key Findings"</a>).</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Reflection in the Context of my Experiences</h2>
      <p>These issues regarding police data accessibility makes sense, given the troubles I have experienced working on a team trying to request police citation data from the Brockton Police Department. Requesting one dataset, from one department, took 9 months with numerous appeals, including one appeal to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. We cited precedent, obtained information about the internals of their policing database to create a list of steps on how they could export our data to strengthen our request, and the request still ran into obstacle after obstacle.</p>
      <p>The original quote for our request was an absolutely unaffordable quote of $39K with a 275 day wait estimate, with the department citing the need to individually edit every file for data privacy purposes. We didn’t end up owing any money, but we were only able to disprove their need to individually edit every file by having the privilege to have technical knowledge and time to prove that we were correct to their IT and legal departments. This is not knowledge or time that everyone will have the privilege to have.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Even if technically the data is open under legislation, there are clearly still departments that are either reluctant or otherwise incompetent when it comes to handing over data (<a href="sources.html#24">Monck, "Key Findings"</a>; <a href="sources.html#34">Sinyangwe, "About the Data"</a>). This is a barrier to acquiring data, particularly for those who may not have the time or resources for lengthy follow ups and/or appeals on public records requests. These barriers must be considered when exploring the validity of data projects in the context of abolitionist efforts.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the reasons for these barriers to access, the effect is that it is very difficult to get data to quantify the harms that police are doing in the communities that they are in. By preventing police critical and anti-police data advocacy projects from illustrating police violence, this serves to implant police's role in society.</p>
