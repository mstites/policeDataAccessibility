      <p>Police Source Data
        This page is about answering what I think is the most important question of this project: can data projects get
        the police source data they need? When I say police source data, I am referring to the raw data that is
        collected by police departments that ideally, people can access to perform various analyses on. Examples of data
        projects using various forms of policing data can be seen on the Data Project Spotlight page.
      </p>
      <p>Below I outline my process and an overview of the results of my searching experience. But you can also skip
        straight to the acquiring data section if you would just like to read the raw information on what it is like to
        obtain this data.</p>
      <div>
        <!--Process section-->
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>When I went to answer the question of police data accessibility, my goal was to find answers to a few key
          questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the policy regarding obtaining policing data? I.e. How should it work in theory according to
            legislation?</li>
          <li>What is the real world experience of data projects, and data scientists, when gathering data for data
            advocacy projects?</li>
          <li>And, related to the above, what is the quality of the data once (/if) obtained?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These three questions were chosen to help provide a broad overview of what the state of police data
          accessibility is like. I also believed that answering these questions would cover the most commonly asked
          questions that I get when I bring up my work using policing data. I donâ€™t have all the answers, even though I
          do that work, and I wanted to find at least the beginnings of them.</p>
        <p>For finding answers, I conducted a number of searches to draw on a broad array of potential sources. These
          sources included database searches for academic papers and articles, data advocacy projects, articles written
          by data scientists doing this work, legal resources about policy, government databases, and official
          government websites on legislation and records requests processes. </p>

        <!-- Results in Short-->
        <h3>Results in Short</h3>
        <p>I found a number of large data advocacy projects that included insightful information on their records
          request experiences. This combined with articles written by people doing this work and the exploration of
          government data portals allowed me to confidently provide perspective on questions #2 and #3.</p>
        <p>Hoever, I was ultimately unable to find the kinds of information I really desired to answer the questions
          regarding police data acquisition policy. While I was able to find ample information on federal data processes
          (under FOIA, more information below), I was unable to find reputable, up-to-date, and applicable sources for
          the state legislation which covers policing data (often called FOI legislation, varies significantly state to
          state).</p>
